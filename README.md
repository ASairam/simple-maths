Simple math functions in (mostly) python

This project will be dedicated to create simple (and hopefully) fast mathematical functions.
The project will be mostly for educational purposes, and can be used by anyone who may desire so.

You may also, if you so desire, contribute to the project.
The idea is to use as few external libraries as possible, and only use built-in python libraries.
